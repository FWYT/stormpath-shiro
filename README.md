The `stormpath-shiro` plugin allows an [Apache Shiro](http://shiro.apache.org)-enabled application

Pairing Shiro with Stormpath gives you a full application security system complete with immediate user account
support, authentication, account registration and password reset workflows, password security and more -
with little to no coding on your part.
